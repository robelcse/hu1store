If we have to send your product to the manufacturer or their repair agent, we will ask them to assess the product and provide their assessment within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
                                <li><strong>c)</strong> Where the assessment finds that there is no fault with the product, or that the product has been damaged due to use of the product by you for a purpose for which it is not intended, outside its recommended parameters or specifications, or circumstances otherwise beyond our control, we may require, at our option, that you compensate us for any fees incurred by us in relation to the assessment.</li>
                                <li><strong>d)</strong> Once your product assessment is completed, we will inform you whether your warranty claim is accepted, and whether we will repair, replace or refund your product.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>13.5</strong> Subject to clause 13.2, you acknowledge and agree that, we are not the manufacturer or producer of any Standard Product, and the only warranties offered in respect of a Standard Product are those of the manufacturer.</li>
                        <li><strong>13.6</strong> If you encounter an issue with a Standard Product, we recommend that you contact the manufacturer's customer assistance department directly. Even if the manufacturer's warranty has expired, the manufacturer is obliged (and best placed) to assess the nature, cause and extent of a failure or fault if you believe your consumer guarantees have been breached.</li>
                        <li><strong>13.7</strong> Subject to clause 13.2, we provide a 1 year return-to-base warranty on labour for all Build-to-order Products (System Warranty), unless otherwise stated on your invoice. The System Warranty commences from the date shown on your tax invoice. Where it can be proved in accordance with clause 13.4 that there is a fault with a Standard Product component in the Build-to-order Product, this warranty covers:
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>a)</strong> the return of the Build-to-order Product to HU1;</li>
                                <li><strong>b)</strong> HU1 replacing the faulty Standard Product component with a replacement; and</li>
                                <li><strong>c)</strong> HU1 delivering the Build-to-order Product back to you.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>13.8</strong> If you encounter any issues with the Build-to-order Product outside the System Warranty period, you will need to identify what you believe is the faulty Standard Product component, and return that component to us in accordance with the normal returns procedure in clause 6.3, for us to assess whether that component is faulty and can be accepted as a warranty claim.</li>
                        <li><strong>13.9</strong> If you return any Product capable of retaining user-generated data then we hereby give you notice that the repair of those goods may result in the loss of the data. Your data is not covered by any warranty. You are entirely responsible for any data on your device and should maintain a regular backup of the data.</li>
                        <li><strong>13.10</strong> Software problems including but not limited to corrupted system files or issues caused by viruses, Trojan horses, malicious and/or third party software are not covered by any warranty, implied or explicit.</li>
